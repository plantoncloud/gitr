# Rule: Create Gitr Changelog (action)

Purpose: When invoked, create a comprehensive changelog document in the `_changelog/` directory that captures the essence, context, and impact of recent engineering work. The changelog should be meaningful, well-structured, and appropriately sized based on the scope and impact of the change.

Usage: Invoke explicitly as `@create-gitr-changelog` after completing meaningful work in a conversation.

References: `@commit-gitr-changes`, existing changelogs in `_changelog/`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Explicit Invocation Only

**DO NOT** create a changelog automatically or proactively. Changelogs must ONLY be created when the user explicitly invokes this rule with `@create-gitr-changelog`.

Never:
- ❌ Suggest creating a changelog without being asked
- ❌ Create a changelog at the end of a conversation automatically
- ❌ Assume the user wants a changelog created
- ❌ Create a changelog "to be helpful" without explicit request

Always:
- ✅ Wait for explicit `@create-gitr-changelog` invocation
- ✅ Confirm the request before creating the file
- ✅ Let the user decide when/if a changelog is needed

**This is a user-controlled action, not an automatic process.**

## When to Create a Changelog

Create a changelog when:
- ✅ You've completed a meaningful feature, refactoring, or improvement
- ✅ The work involved multiple files or components
- ✅ The change introduces new commands or significant enhancements
- ✅ The work took significant time/effort (typically 1+ hours)
- ✅ The change has notable impact on gitr users or functionality
- ✅ You want to preserve the context and rationale for future reference

**Skip changelogs for**:
- ✋ Trivial bug fixes or typo corrections
- ✋ Minor configuration tweaks
- ✋ Work-in-progress or incomplete changes
- ✋ Changes already well-documented in PR descriptions

## Sizing Guidance: Use Your Judgment

**Critical principle**: The changelog length should be **proportional to the feature's complexity and impact**, not artificially constrained or inflated.

### Small Changes (150-300 lines)
- Single command updates or enhancements
- Focused bug fixes with clear before/after
- Minor flag additions
- Configuration improvements
- URL handling improvements

**Example**: Adding dry-run flag to commands - straightforward problem, clear solution, limited scope

### Medium Changes (300-600 lines)
- New command implementations
- Significant refactoring of core packages
- Integration with new SCM providers
- Multi-component improvements

**Example**: Remote branch validation with fallback - new pattern, multiple functions, improved UX

### Large Changes (600-1000+ lines)
- Major architectural changes
- Complete rewrites of subsystems
- New provider support with comprehensive testing
- System-wide refactoring with broad impact

**Example**: Complete SSH config management system, multi-provider web URL support

**Golden rule**: If you're unsure, start shorter and add detail only where it adds real value. Quality over quantity.

## Changelog Structure

### File Naming
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-brief-descriptive-slug.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-11-14-180530-remote-branch-validation.md`
- `2025-11-10-143022-gorelease-v2-upgrade.md`
- `2025-11-05-091545-new-rem-command.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Get the actual current timestamp by running the command `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` and use that exact output as the prefix for the filename. Do NOT make up or guess the timestamp. Follow with a clear, kebab-case slug describing the change. The timestamp (HHMMSS) ensures automatic chronological sorting when multiple changelogs are created on the same day.

### Required Sections

Every changelog should include:

```markdown
# [Clear, Descriptive Title]

**Date**: [Month Day, Year]

## Summary

[2-4 sentence overview of what was accomplished and why it matters]

## Problem Statement

[Describe the problem or need that motivated this work]

### Pain Points

[Bullet list of specific issues being addressed]

## Solution

[High-level description of the approach taken]

### Key Components

[Component descriptions, affected packages, new functions]

## Implementation Details

[Technical specifics - code changes, new patterns, key decisions]

## Benefits

[Concrete improvements - UX enhancements, performance, reliability]

## Impact

[Who/what is affected and how - users, developers, workflows]

## Related Work

[Connect to other changelogs, features, or initiatives]

---

**Status**: ✅ [Production Ready | In Progress | Experimental]
**Timeline**: [Duration if relevant]
```

### Optional Sections (Include When Valuable)

Add these sections only when they provide meaningful value:

- **Breaking Changes**: When CLI flags, commands, or behavior changes
- **Migration Guide**: When users need to update their workflows
- **Testing Strategy**: For complex features requiring verification
- **Performance Characteristics**: When performance is a key concern
- **Known Limitations**: For incomplete implementations
- **Future Enhancements**: For planned follow-up work
- **Code Metrics**: Statistics that tell a story (files changed, LOC, etc.)
- **Design Decisions**: When trade-offs were significant
- **Examples/Usage**: When it helps understanding (command examples, outputs)
- **Supported Providers**: When SCM provider support is affected (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

## Writing Guidelines

### Do:
- ✅ **Start with context**: Why did this work happen?
- ✅ **Focus on value**: What problem does this solve for gitr users?
- ✅ **Use concrete examples**: Show before/after commands, outputs
- ✅ **Include numbers**: Metrics, file counts, performance improvements
- ✅ **Explain decisions**: Why this approach vs alternatives?
- ✅ **Write for future you**: Capture the thinking, not just the what
- ✅ **Link to related work**: Connect the dots with other changes
- ✅ **Use formatting**: Code blocks, tables, bullet lists for readability
- ✅ **Show user impact**: How does this improve the user experience?

### Don't:
- ❌ **Over-explain the obvious**: Assume the reader is technical
- ❌ **Include every detail**: Focus on what matters
- ❌ **Write generic summaries**: Be specific to gitr's functionality
- ❌ **Skip the "why"**: Context is critical for future understanding
- ❌ **Ignore trade-offs**: Document decisions and their rationale
- ❌ **Use jargon without context**: Define terms that may be unclear

## Tone and Style

- **Informative, not promotional**: Focus on facts and impact
- **Technical but accessible**: Balance depth with clarity
- **Professional but human**: You can say "this was tricky" or "users were frustrated"
- **Present tense for descriptions**: "The command now does X"
- **Past tense for actions**: "We implemented Y"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a changelog:

- [ ] Title clearly describes the change
- [ ] Summary captures essence in 2-4 sentences
- [ ] Problem statement explains why work was needed
- [ ] Solution section describes the approach
- [ ] Implementation details are technical but focused
- [ ] Benefits are concrete and measurable
- [ ] Code/command examples are actual examples, not pseudocode
- [ ] Related work connects this to other changes
- [ ] Length is proportional to scope and impact
- [ ] No sensitive information (credentials, private URLs, etc.)

## Proportionality Examples

### ✅ Good: Appropriately Sized

**Small feature** (200 lines): 
- Problem: 1 paragraph
- Solution: 1-2 paragraphs + key code snippet or command example
- Benefits: 3-5 bullets
- Impact: 1 paragraph

**Medium feature** (500 lines):
- Problem: 2-3 paragraphs with pain points
- Solution: Architecture description + component details
- Implementation: 3-4 key changes with examples
- Benefits: Categorized list with user impact
- Impact: User experience + workflow improvements

**Large feature** (900 lines):
- Problem: Comprehensive context with user scenarios
- Solution: Full architecture with component breakdown
- Implementation: Detailed technical sections per component
- Benefits: Quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Testing: Strategy and verification steps
- Impact: Multi-dimensional (users, workflows, integrations)

### ❌ Anti-patterns

- **Over-detailed small change**: 800-line changelog for a simple flag addition
- **Under-documented major change**: 150-line changelog for complete provider rewrite
- **Kitchen sink**: Including every file touched, every line changed
- **Too abstract**: Generic descriptions without concrete command examples

## Gitr-Specific Guidelines

### Scope Areas to Cover

When writing changelogs for gitr, consider these areas:

**Commands**:
- Which commands were added, modified, or removed?
- How do command behaviors change?
- What new flags or options are available?

**SCM Provider Support**:
- Which providers are affected? (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Datacenter)
- Are URL patterns updated?
- Is provider detection improved?

**User Workflows**:
- How does this improve daily git workflows?
- What time does it save?
- What frustrations does it eliminate?

**Package Architecture**:
- Which packages were affected? (`pkg/git`, `pkg/web`, `pkg/config`, etc.)
- What new abstractions or patterns were introduced?
- How does this affect code organization?

**Dependencies & Build**:
- Were dependencies updated?
- Did the build system change?
- Are there new installation requirements?

### Command Example Format

When showing command examples, use this format:

```bash
# Before
$ gitr rem
# Opens browser to non-existent branch, shows 404

# After
$ gitr rem
WARN[0001] Branch 'feature-xyz' doesn't exist on remote. Opening default branch instead.
# Opens browser to main branch successfully
```

## Automation Notes

When creating the changelog:
1. **Get current timestamp**: Run `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` to get the actual current date and time for the filename
2. **Analyze the conversation**: Extract key decisions, changes, outcomes
3. **Assess scope**: Count files, packages, commands affected
4. **Determine sections**: Include only relevant sections
5. **Size appropriately**: Match detail level to impact
6. **Write the file**: Create in `_changelog/YYYY-MM/` (year-month directory) with proper naming using the timestamp from step 1
7. **Confirm creation**: Provide file path and next steps

## Example Invocations

```
"We just completed the remote branch validation feature. @create-gitr-changelog"

"I've finished upgrading to GoReleaser v2 with all the config changes. 
@create-gitr-changelog"

"The new rem command with fallback logic is done and tested. 
@create-gitr-changelog - this improves UX significantly"
```

## Remember

**Changelogs are living documentation** that helps future developers (including you) understand:
- What changed in gitr
- Why it changed
- How it was implemented
- What the user impact was

Write for the person who will need to understand this feature or debug an issue at 2am in six months. Give them the context they need - no more, no less.

**When in doubt**: Start with the required sections, keep it focused, and add detail only where it truly helps understanding. A clear, concise 300-line changelog is better than a rambling 1000-line document.
